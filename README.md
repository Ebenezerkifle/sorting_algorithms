## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/03JBpl8AIIRD3G2gUzXVew "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   At least four different sorting algorithms
-   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-   What is a stable sorting algorithm
